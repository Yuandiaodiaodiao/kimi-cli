const DESCRIPTION = `Send a message to the past, just like sending a D-Mail in Steins;Gate.

This tool is provided to enable you to proactively manage the context. You can see some \`user\` messages with text \`CHECKPOINT {checkpoint_id}\` wrapped in \`<system>\` tags in the context. When you feel there is too much irrelevant information in the current context, you can send a D-Mail to revert the context to a previous checkpoint with a message containing only the useful information.

After a D-Mail is sent, the system will revert the current context to the specified checkpoint. You must make it very clear in the message what you have done/changed, what you have learned, so that your past self can continue the task without confusion.

When sending a D-Mail, DO NOT explain to the user. Just explain to your past self.`;
